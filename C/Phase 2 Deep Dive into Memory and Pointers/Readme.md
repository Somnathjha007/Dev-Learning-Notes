# 🚀 **Phase 2 — Deep Dive: Memory, Pointers & Data Structures**

In this phase, we go from “writing code” → to **understanding how C really works inside the machine.**

We’ll study how C interacts with **RAM, the stack, and the heap**, and then move into building data structures manually using pointers.

## 🧩 **Phase 2 — Outline**

| Lesson | Topic                          | Core Focus                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣    | **Pointers (Deep Level)**      | Pointer arithmetic, indirection, pointer to pointer |
| 2️⃣    | **Arrays & Strings Internals** | Relationship between arrays and pointers            |
| 3️⃣    | **Dynamic Memory Allocation**  | `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`               |
| 4️⃣    | **Structures and Typedef**     | User-defined data types and memory layout           |
| 5️⃣    | **Unions and Enums**           | How they work and why they exist                    |
| 6️⃣    | **Pointers to Structures**     | `->` operator, passing structs to functions         |
| 7️⃣    | **Linked Lists**               | Building your own data structure manually           |
| 8️⃣    | **Function Pointers**          | How functions are stored and called by pointer      |
| 9️⃣    | **Memory Debugging & Safety**  | Dangling pointers, leaks, segmentation faults       |
