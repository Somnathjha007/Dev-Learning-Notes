Perfect 👌 — I’ll be your **C programming mentor** and guide you **from absolute fundamentals to deep system-level mastery**.

Let’s set the stage first.
Here’s how I’ll teach you — like a professional developer teaching another developer:

---

## 🧭 Learning Plan (High-Level Roadmap)

### 🩵 **Phase 1: Foundations of C**

You’ll understand not just *how*, but *why* things work.

* What is C? — History, compilation model, low-level nature.
* Structure of a C program.
* Data types, variables, constants.
* Operators and expressions.
* Input/Output (stdio.h essentials).
* Control flow (if, switch, loops).
* Functions (declaration, definition, call stack).
* Storage classes (auto, static, extern, register).

---

### 🧩 **Phase 2: Deep Dive into Memory & Pointers**

This is where real C mastery begins.

* Memory layout (stack, heap, data, code segments).
* Pointers: declaration, dereferencing, pointer arithmetic.
* Arrays and pointer equivalence.
* Function pointers.
* Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`).
* Common pointer pitfalls (dangling, wild, null).

---

### 🧱 **Phase 3: Complex Data Structures**

* Structures and nested structures.
* Unions and bitfields.
* Enums.
* Linked lists, stacks, queues (manual implementation).
* String handling and manipulation.

---

### ⚙️ **Phase 4: Compilation, Preprocessing & File Handling**

* The C compilation pipeline (`.c` → `.o` → executable).
* Preprocessor directives (`#define`, `#include`, macros).
* Header files and modular programming.
* File I/O (fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, fseek, etc.).

---

### 🧠 **Phase 5: Advanced Concepts**

* Recursion and stack frames.
* Function pointers and callbacks.
* Inline assembly.
* Volatile, const, restrict keywords.
* Error handling and debugging.
* C standard libraries.
* Writing Makefiles and multi-file projects.
* Memory debugging tools (valgrind, gdb).

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Phase 6: System-Level Programming (Optional Advanced Path)**

* Working with command-line arguments.
* Processes and `fork()`.
* Signals and IPC.
* File descriptors and system calls.
* Sockets and networking (if you want).
* Writing a mini shell or OS-level utilities.

Now before we start:
👉 Tell me where you want to begin:

1. **Absolute Beginner** — start from *“What is C?”* and build up step-by-step.
2. **Intermediate** — you already know syntax but want *in-depth* explanations of memory, pointers, and compilation.
3. **Advanced** — you want to learn *system-level C*, performance tuning, and embedded programming concepts.

Once you choose, I’ll start the lessons interactively — with **real code examples**, **memory diagrams**, and **practical insights** from a C developer’s perspective.
